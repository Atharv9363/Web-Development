        A computer is a digital electronic machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or
        logical operations (computation) automatically. Modern computers can perform generic sets of operations known as
        programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. A computer system is a "complete"
        computer that includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed and used
        for "full" operation. This term may also refer to a group of computers that are linked and function together,
        such as a computer network or computer cluster.

        A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems. Simple special-purpose
        devices like microwave ovens and remote controls are included, as are factory devices like industrial robots and
        computer-aided design, as well as general-purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices like
        smartphones. Computers power the Internet, which links billions of other computers and users.

        Early computers were meant to be used only for calculations. Simple manual instruments like the abacus have
        aided people in doing calculations since ancient times. Early in the Industrial Revolution, some mechanical
        devices were built to automate long tedious tasks, such as guiding patterns for looms. More sophisticated
        electrical machines did specialized analog calculations in the early 20th century. The first digital electronic
        calculating machines were developed during World War II. The first semiconductor transistors in the late 1940s
        were followed by the silicon-based MOSFET (MOS transistor) and monolithic integrated circuit (IC) chip
        technologies in the late 1950s, leading to the microprocessor and the microcomputer revolution in the 1970s. The
        speed, power and versatility of computers have been increasing dramatically ever since then, with transistor
        counts increasing at a rapid pace (as predicted by Moore's law), leading to the Digital Revolution during the
        late 20th to early 21st centuries.

        Conventionally, a modern computer consists of at least one processing element, typically a central processing
        unit (CPU) in the form of a microprocessor, along with some type of computer memory, typically semiconductor
        memory chips. The processing element carries out arithmetic and logical operations, and a sequencing and control
        unit can change the order of operations in response to stored information. Peripheral devices include input
        devices (keyboards, mice, joystick, etc.), output devices (monitor screens, printers, etc.), and input/output
        devices that perform both functions (e.g., the 2000s-era touchscreen). Peripheral devices allow information to
        be retrieved from an external source and they enable the result of operations to be saved and retrieved.</p>

    <H2>Etymology</H2>
    <p>A human computer.
        A human computer, with microscope and calculator, 1952
        According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first known use of computer was in a 1613 book called The Yong
        Mans Gleanings by the English writer Richard Brathwait: "I haue [sic] read the truest computer of Times, and the
        best Arithmetician that euer [sic] breathed, and he reduceth thy dayes into a short number." This usage of the
        term referred to a human computer, a person who carried out calculations or computations. The word continued
        with the same meaning until the middle of the 20th century. During the latter part of this period women were
        often hired as computers because they could be paid less than their male counterparts.[1] By 1943, most human
        computers were women.[2]

        The Online Etymology Dictionary gives the first attested use of computer in the 1640s, meaning 'one who
        calculates'; this is an "agent noun from compute (v.)". The Online Etymology Dictionary states that the use of
        the term to mean "'calculating machine' (of any type) is from 1897." The Online Etymology Dictionary indicates
        that the "modern use" of the term, to mean 'programmable digital electronic computer' dates from "1945 under
        this name; [in a] theoretical [sense] from 1937, as Turing machine".[3]</p>
